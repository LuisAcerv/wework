Key features of remote employee monitoring software.

## Basic capabilities

Below are some of the core functionalities that you can expect from most remote employee monitoring systems.

### Time logging
This keeps track of the employee’s time logged into the system. For example, if an employee logs in to the remote monitoring program at 8:00 a.m. and logs out at 4:00 p.m., the software will record and log that employee’s time as eight hours.

### Active time tracking
Active time tracks the time during a session that someone is typing or moving their mouse. This metric is then logged, so that administrators or managers can monitor the employee’s total active time. For example, if a remote employee logs eight hours on a specific date and is typing or using their mouse for six hours, the system will report the total hours, and what percent of that time was considered active time (in this case, 75% active time for the eight-hour session).

### Screenshot monitoring
Remote employee monitoring software can be used to record screenshots of the employee’s computer across specific time intervals, ranging from once every few minutes to once every few hours. This allows an administrator or manager to see thumbnails of actual screens displayed during the work session. By consulting these screenshots, managers can make sure that each employee stays on track, and is using their computer only for work-appropriate tasks.

### Project management / task tracking
Many remote employee monitoring software programs are equipped with basic project management capabilities to help track progress on various tasks. Although this is not meant to serve as a replacement for a truly dedicated project management software system, this functionality can be especially helpful for teams that are located across several different geographic regions, and that need some basic project management capabilities.
